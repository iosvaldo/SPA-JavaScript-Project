Our webpage will help people decide what to cook. Our app will highlight randomly generated interesting meals worldwide with a list of ingredients. Upon loading the page, users will see the highlight meal/recipe of the day on the front page. Each meal will feature the necessary ingredients and instructions for preparation. 
Users will be able to create a grocery list and temporarily save it to the age, add a review, and like reviews left on the page. 
We use the TheMealDB API, category: List all Categories, Area, Ingredients.
